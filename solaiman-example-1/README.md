In this example I followed the Basic Uses from two.js library.
By using this library i created 5 orange circles in random positions and later an event listener to draw white circles over those orange circles depending on mouse event where the mouse has being clicked.
This prototype can be used to provide an interactive feedback to the user that it responds when the user is interacting with the mouse. 
For this example I took help from the two.js library Basic Usage https://two.js.org/#two-rounded-rectangle
(This is Solaiman's example 1)
