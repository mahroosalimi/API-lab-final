Spinning shapes, 
this example illustrates four different shapes that spin and move around the canvas as a group. This example is from Two.js and the only api it uses is two.js. This example has shown me that it can be used for 2-dimensional prototyping and GUI. Liam Melin-Higgins has made changes to this example, the original file can be found at https://two.js.org/#download
