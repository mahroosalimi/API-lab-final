Spinning Star 3 - Priscilla Silva

This example is a variation of “Spinning Star 1”. In this case, a second star, a green one, has been added and modified to spin in a counterclockwise motion as opposed to the pink star. A CSS file has been added in order to change the background color of the canvas to black.

The result is an animation that resembles the gears of an engine.
