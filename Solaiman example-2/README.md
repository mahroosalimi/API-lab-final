For this  example I explored the two.js library and created different objects with different shapes. 
By using the library I could create different shapes with two.js  built-in methods
Using this library I could create quick prototype of different shapes which could be used as a GUI element
By adding the shapes to a group I could manage multiple shapes and easily move the content and change colours as two.js accepts all valid css color
For this example I took help from the two.js library Shapes and Groups https://two.js.org/#basic-usage
(This is Solaiman's example 2)
