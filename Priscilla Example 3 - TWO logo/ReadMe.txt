TWO.js logo - Priscilla Silva

This example consists of a recreation of the Two.js logo. The "T consists of two rectangles in the shape of a cross created
through the makeRectangle method; the "W" was made though the method makePath; and finally, the "O" consists of two
superimposed circles created through makeCircle method. A CSS file was added to change the background color to green.

The result is a scaled-up version of the TWO.js logo that we used in our presentation.
