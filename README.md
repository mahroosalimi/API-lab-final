# API-lab-final
What the project does:
The project consists of a series of examples to show how the library Two.js can be used. Two.js is a 2D drawing API that is utilized for modern web browsers. It can be used to render graphics easier via contexts like SVG, canvas, and Webgl.

By itself, Two.js can be useful to draw basic two-dimensional shapes such as circles, rectangles and even polygons and stars. One can also animate these shapes to make them spin or rotate at different speeds. However, if the user wishes to create more dynamic projects they must rely on other libraries to accomplish that.

Why the project is useful:
Working with the project and, specifically, the library Two.js, has taught us that it can be used for mainly prototyping and web design/GUI. Because the library uses SVG, it is perfect for two-dimensional prototyping since one can scale the objects up and down without interfering with the quality of the final prototypes. In addition to that, Two.js allows the user to group shapes in order to simplify the process of styling and animating them.

This project was meant for us to explore faster and easier ways to prototype with already written code by others. It also was about trying to understand other people’s code and experiment with them to achieve the desired prototype. In some cases we encountered some issues and bugs in the code. Still, we made it work.

How users can get started with the project:
Getting started with Two.js can be a bit tricky. In many of the examples, they use not only their own library but a number of third party libraries as well. This means that one will have to download several APIs before one can edit the code in the examples. Two.js is known to have certain bugs that can sometimes affect the functionality of a few methods. We experienced this first hand when working with the API. However, working only with Two.js and not any extended APIs makes it a lot easier to get started. The library’s documentation is well made and simple enough for users with little experience to understand.

One of the first issues we had with Two.js was linking it to the DOM. After downloading the library, we were not able to link it with the script offered on the official website. However, the script for the minimized version, <script src="./two.min.js"></script>, seemed to work fine.

Who maintains and contributes to the project:
Mahroo Salimi, Priscilla Silva, Liam Melin-Higgins and Md Solaiman Islam.

From figuring out how GitHub worked, to making commits, we all contributed in some way or another. The group has worked individually on the examples and helped each other if needed.  We all tried at least two examples each. By doing so we all got our own experience working with the library.
